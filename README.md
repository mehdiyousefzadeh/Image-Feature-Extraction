# Image-Feature-Extraction

Create a Python package that includes these feature extraction techniques from 2D data such as images, we'll organize our package into multiple modules, each dedicated to a specific type of feature extraction. We'll use popular libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV, scikit-image, and scikit-learn to implement these features. Here's an outline of how the package can be structured and a detailed implementation for each feature extraction method.

image_feature_extraction/
|-- image_feature_extraction/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- texture_features.py
|   |-- histogram_features.py
|   |-- shape_features.py
|   |-- wavelet_features.py
|   |-- geometric_features.py
|   |-- topological_features.py
|-- setup.py
|-- README.md
|-- requirements.txt
|-- tests/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- test_texture_features.py
|   |-- test_histogram_features.py
|   |-- test_shape_features.py
|   |-- test_wavelet_features.py
|   |-- test_geometric_features.py
|   |-- test_topological_features.py

# Final Steps
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the tests using a test runner like pytest to ensure all features are correctly implemented.
Build and distribute your package using python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel and twine upload dist/*.
This setup provides a comprehensive framework for extracting various features from 2D images using different techniques. Each module can be further expanded and optimized based on specific requirements and use cases.
