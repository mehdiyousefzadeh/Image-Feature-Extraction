# Image-Feature-Extraction

Create a Python package that includes these feature extraction techniques from 2D data such as images, we'll organize our package into multiple modules, each dedicated to a specific type of feature extraction. We'll use popular libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV, scikit-image, and scikit-learn to implement these features. Here's an outline of how the package can be structured and a detailed implementation for each feature extraction method.


# Final Steps
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the tests using a test runner like pytest to ensure all features are correctly implemented.
Build and distribute your package using python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel and twine upload dist/*.
This setup provides a comprehensive framework for extracting various features from 2D images using different techniques. Each module can be further expanded and optimized based on specific requirements and use cases.
